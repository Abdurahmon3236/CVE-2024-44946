Usage of the Enhanced PoC:
Compile the PoC Code:

bash
Copy code
gcc -o kcm_uaf_poc_advanced kcm_uaf_poc_advanced.c -pthread
Run the PoC:

bash
Copy code
sudo ./kcm_uaf_poc_advanced
The advanced PoC should simulate a highly complex race condition, potentially triggering the UAF vulnerability in the Linux kernel. You can check the kernel logs using dmesg or similar tools.
Analyze Kernel Logs:

Inspect the logs for any signs of a UAF or related kernel memory corruption. The use of KASAN or other debugging tools is recommended to catch any subtle issues.
